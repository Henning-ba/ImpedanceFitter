Overview
========

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is a great tool to analyse the behaviour of an electrical circuit,
to characterise the response of a sample (e.g. biological tissue), to determine the dielectric 
properties of a sample, and much more [Barsoukov2018]_.

Data analysis in IS relies often on non-linear least squares for parameter estimation
of equivalent circuit models.
ImpedanceFitter is a software that facilitates parameter estimation for arbitrary equivalent circuit models.
The equivalent circuit may comprise different standard elements or 
other models that have been formulated in the context of impedance spectroscopy.
The unknown parameters are found by fitting the model to experimental impedance data.
The underlying fitting software is LMFIT [Newville2019]_, which offers an interface to different optimization and curve-fitting 
methods going beyond standard least-squares.
ImpedanceFitter allows one to build a custom equivalent circuit, fit an arbitrary amount of data sets and 
perform statistical analysis of the results.
