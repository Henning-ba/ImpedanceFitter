ImpedanceFitter
===============

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is in the `doc`
directory and requires [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html)
to be installed.


Installation
------------

If you want to install the code from source,
clone into a local directory.

`cd` into this directory and run

```
pip3 install . --user
```

or if you only have python3 on your computer

```
pip install . --user
```

in this directory.
It will install all requirements automatically.

Testing
-------

The tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
Simply run `pytest` inside the repository main directory.
