===============

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available at [INSERT READTHEDOCS LINK].

If you want to compile it locally:
The documentation is in the `doc`
directory and requires [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html)
to be compiled.


Installation
------------

ImpedanceFitter can be installed using pip
(not yet working, WIP)

```
pip install impedancefitter
```

If you want to install the code from source,
clone into a local directory.

`cd` into this directory and run

```
pip install . --user
```

in this directory.
It will install all requirements automatically.

Testing
-------

The tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
Simply run `pytest` inside the repository main directory.
